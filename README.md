## Key Widget Attributes
The implementation focuses on these three critical attributes of the **Draggable** widget:
* **data**: The color object (payload) being transferred to the target.
* **feedback**: The visual widget that follows the user's touch during the drag.
* **childWhenDragging**: The placeholder widget that remains in the original list while the item is in motion
